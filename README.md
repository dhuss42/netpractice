# NetPractice
Discover the basics of networking

In this project, I explored the fundamentals of networking by configuring small-scale networks in a simulated environment. Unlike most other projects at 42, this one was not about coding but focused on understanding IP and Mask addressing and troubleshooting network issues. I completed 10 levels of networking challenges, ensuring proper functionality and submitting my configurations for evaluation. During the final evaluation, I had to solve three randomly selected networking levels within a strict 15-minute time limit.
