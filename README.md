# NetPractice
Discover the basics of networking

## General Information

In this project, I explored the fundamentals of networking by configuring small-scale networks in a simulated environment. Unlike most other projects at 42, this one was not about coding but focused on understanding IP and Mask addressing and troubleshooting network issues. I completed 10 levels of networking challenges, ensuring proper functionality and submitting my configurations for evaluation. During the final evaluation, I had to solve three randomly selected networking levels within a strict 15-minute time limit.

## Example Exercise

The following is an exercise I had to solve during this project.
Description of the Exercise

The following image shows one of the exercises I had to solve during this project.

Each device has a box with two fields labeled "IP:" and "Mask:", some of which are already filled in at the start of the exercise. The task is to use subnetting to properly connect the devices to each other and, in certain cases, to the internet.

Devices and the internet will also have a "Routes" box that contains two fields: the first is the final destination network address, and the second is the next router. If the destination does not matter, we can fill in "default."
